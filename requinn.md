## About the Products

* Amazon is a well known online retailer, selling anything and everything from books to car tires.
* 40% of all products sold (2008) come from third party retailers.
	* To put into numbers, that's out of 163,393,168 products in their catalog (as of 4/26/15).

## Regulation

* How does Amazon make sure all of these products fall within the lines?
	* All sellers are required to sign off an agreement of their policies.
 		* From many people's experiences, signing a Terms of Agreement doesn't always mean they will be followed.
	* Users may also report an item for inappropriate content.
		* i.e. Erotic literature in a kid's books category.
	* Bots trawl each page looking for specific keywords that may go against the rules.
		* i.e. Medication stating "Hepatitis" (Future note (Remove later): Amazon doesn't allow STD meds for sale.)

## Slide 3

* With such large catalogue of items, things are bound to fall through.
* In 2006, Amazon was reported to be carrying two cock-fighting magazines and two dog fighting videos in their stock.
* This prompted a lawsuit from the Human Society of the US (HSUS).


How does amazon regulate their products?
Most of the time it is up to the retailers themselves, with amazon merely reselling the product. 
With enough flags or reports, it may be taken down by customers who find the products faulty or inappropriate. 

Some items are illegal in certain countries, but no in others.
